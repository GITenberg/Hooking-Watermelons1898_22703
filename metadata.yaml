description: Edward Bellamy is best remembered for the utopian novel Looking Backward,
  which had a profound cultural impact when it was published, inciting many readers
  to form organizations seeking to put the book's ideas into practice. The charming
  short story ""Hooking Watermelons, "" chock-full of local color, illustrates how
  something as seemingly innocuous as a melon patch can actually be a symbol of intractable
  social divides.
